# SciAPI

Have you guys heard of the **POKEAPI**? :shipit:

I find it awesome as well! 

> But I kept thinking why would we need pokemons, if we have very wild persons that passed through the earth?  

## **Thats why we decided to create SCIAPI**. 
### We want you, to discover all the information about the mad scientists that existed on our planet.
